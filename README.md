Given a set of Xs and a set of Ys, the model should be able to figure out the relationship between them.

<h4> Notebook 2 - Exercise_1_House_Prices_Question.ipynb (Coursera Programming Assignment 1) </h4>
Build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.
Create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.
